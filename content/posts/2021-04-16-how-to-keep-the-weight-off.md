## Learn how to keep the weight you've already lost off - the right way.

As if losing weight wasn't hard enough - now we're telling you that keeping the weight off is something you need to learn how to do as well... and it isn't always easy.

### Why Do Most People Struggle Keeping The Weight Off?

Well, simply put - Old Habits Die Hard.

For most of us we have an idea of what habits are holding us back. The problem is, habit change tends to be really hard if not done correctly.

If you are someone who is determined, and you really want or need to make a change with your nutrition habits, you can probably bite down (pardon the pun) and push through 6 months of denying those unsavoury habits. This is where a lot of weight-loss happens. 

The problem comes up when life gets hard. Maybe a bad day or a bad week throws a fork in your routine. You have one bad meal and suddenly you don't care about being healthy the rest of the day, then one bad day turns into one bad week, and so on. People easily fall into this trap and there is a simple way to avoid it that might arguably be much easier.

### What's the easiest way to keep the weight off?

Well, since each individual is going to need something different we'll give you some general.

Right now most people are cutting out all the bad stuff cold turkey and then trying to maintain this new change. Not only is this a very hard way to make changes to your lifestyle, often the changes don't last.

The most successful method is to slowly lean off your habits to a point where you are no longer missing them. Your plan needs to look at how you're going to remove these habits from your life without wanting to go back to them. Don't go cold turkey on the ice cream!

We need to ration our expectations.

### So does that mean I can eat Ice Cream?

The short answer? Yes.

Let's use Ice Cream as an example. If one of your biggest challenges is eating too much ice cream, instead of stopping cold turkey, this is a better way to look at it.

Reduce the amount of ice cream you are eating in one sitting. You can still eat ice cream, but let's start to gain some portion control. Easy!

Next, reduce the frequency of how often you're eating ice cream. If you eat it every day, change to every other day. No problem!

Gradually start to decrease the frequency over a few weeks until you're only eating ice cream once a week (or less!). 

This method does two things:

1. Reduces the cravings that your body has for these substances by changing the frequency that your body expects.

2. Creates a positive habit in the process.

This is only an example of how to make changes with an emphasis on the long term. The success rate with an approach like this is often reported to be more than double the cold turkey method.
